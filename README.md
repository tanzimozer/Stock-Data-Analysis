#Stock Market Analysis: Predicting Prices and Movements
This project analyzes stock market data for 10 major companies (Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks, Apple, Nvidia, Chase Bank, Robinhood, BlackRock, and Google) using Python. It employs technical indicators and machine learning models to predict stock prices and price movements.

#Project Overview

#Objective:
Predict the next day's closing price (Regression).
Predict whether the price will go up or down (Classification).

#Key Features:
Technical Indicators: SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, ADX.
Models: Random Forest Regressor and Classifier.

#Visualizations:
Actual vs Predicted Prices.
Confusion Matrix.
Correlation Heatmaps.

#Project Workflow

#1. Data Collection:
Historical stock data fetched from Alpha Vantage.
Saved raw data as .csv files for each company.

#2. Feature Engineering:
Generated technical indicators (SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, ADX) for enriched datasets.

#3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized stock trends with SMA/EMA.
Analyzed momentum indicators (MACD, RSI).
Explored feature correlations using heatmaps.

#4. Predictive Modeling:
Regression:
Predicted next day's closing price.
Evaluated using metrics like MSE and R².
Classification:
Predicted price direction (Up/Down).
Evaluated using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.

#5. Visualization and Reporting:
Visualized predictions and classification results.
Summarized metrics and generated correlation heatmaps.
Results
Regression:
Example (Tesla):
MSE: 10.32
R²: 0.89
Classification:
Example (Tesla):

Accuracy: 85.6%
Note: Detailed metrics are available in the models/ directory.
